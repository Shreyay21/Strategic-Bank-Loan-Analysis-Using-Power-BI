#  Strategic Bank Loan Analysis using  Power BI Project

Welcome to this project repository! This aims to provide insightful analysis and visualization of bank loan data using Power BI.

# Overview
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key aspects of bank loan data, providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making. The project features three main dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details.

Dashboard 1: Summary

** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
Designed metrics to evaluate loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments. Implemented Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) tracking for total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments. Calculated the average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios to provide a comprehensive view of loan portfolio performance.
** Summary Visualization: 
Developed a Loan Status Grid View to present an overview of lending operations, displaying key metrics like total applications, funded amounts, repayments, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios for better loan management.

Dashboard 2: Overview

** Monthly Trends Analysis:
Utilized line charts to identify seasonal patterns and trends in lending activities.
Regional and Demographic Insights: Created filled maps to highlight regional disparities in loan distribution, along with bar charts and treemaps to analyze loan purposes, borrower employment length, and home ownership's impact on loan metrics.
** Loan Characteristics Analysis: 
Designed donut and bar charts to visualize the distribution of loans by term lengths and purposes, aiding in understanding the diverse lending patterns and customer profiles.

Dashboard 3: Details

** Objective:
Developed a comprehensive dashboard to provide detailed insights into key loan metrics, borrower profiles, and loan performance, supporting efficient portfolio management and data-driven strategy formulation.
** Data Utilization:
Leveraged a diverse dataset encompassing loan IDs, state, purpose, grade, income, status, payment history, verification status, debt-to-income ratios, and interest rates to analyze borrower demographics, employment stability, loan characteristics, risk factors, and payment behaviors.

Outcome:
Enhanced operational efficiency by providing real-time data insights, enabling the optimization of lending strategies, risk management, and performance maximization.
